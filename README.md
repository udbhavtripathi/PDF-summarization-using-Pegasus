# PDF-summarization-using-Pegasus
In this project, I have used the pre-trained PEGASUS model to build a PDF summarizer web app that takes PDF files as input, extracts texts from them and provides a page-wise summary of texts. The blog explaining the setps used can be accessed through this link: https://www.picasoanalytics.com/post/pdf-summarization-using-pegasus
