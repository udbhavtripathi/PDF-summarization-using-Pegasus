# PDF-summarization-using-Pegasus
In this project I have explained how to use the Pegasus model, a pre-trained neural network model developed by Google, to summarize large PDF documents. I have used the PyPDF2 library to read and extract text from a PDF document and then passed the extracted text to the Pegasus model for summarization. Finally, I have built a web App out of the ML model for an easy User Interface and deployed the following on Streamlit. The blog explaining the setps used can be accessed through this link: https://www.picasoanalytics.com/post/pdf-summarization-using-pegasus
